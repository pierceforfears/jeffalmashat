### Jeff Al-Mashat is a working artist who lives on the central coast of California. His work deals with issues of dominance, power struggles and abuse of unchecked power and privilege through a painting process of combining materials that don't mix, either chemically or naturally, creating conflicts on the canvas. His MFA thesis from Georgia State University's Ernest G. Welch School of Art is entitled Oil & Water and features 100 paintings, each with a different combination and reaction. His graduate work also include studying painting and art history in France through the University of West Georgia.

### His work has been exhibited around the United States, in Europe and Central America. He has taught art classes at Georgia State University, Georgia Highlands College and the Art Institute of Atlanta. He also writes a regular column on art for SLO Life Magazine. Jeff has also worked with other local artists to start a community mural program in Grover Beach, CA. The project invites anyone from the community to come and join in giant murals, often painted on the walls of local business. Pictured below is a community mural from 2019 based upon a woodcarving from the Dunites, an artist collective that lived in the Oceano Dunes from the 1920s through the 1970s.
