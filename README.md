### Jeff Al-Mashat is a working artist who lives on the central coast of California. His work deals with issues of dominance, power struggles and abuse of unchecked power and privilege through a painting process of combining materials that don't mix, either chemically or naturally, creating conflicts on the canvas. His MFA thesis from Georgia State University's Ernest G. Welch School of Art is entitled Oil & Water and features 100 paintings, each with a different combination and reaction. His graduate work also include studying painting and art history in France through the University of West Georgia.
