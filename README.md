### Jeff Al-Mashat is an award-winning artist who combines traditional painting media with non-traditional materials to create non-objective works that occur through a process of alchemy. His current body of work furthers this conceptual study with exclusively black and white materials. He graduated from Georgia State University with a Masters in Fine Arts focused in painting in 2007. His thesis consisted of 100 paintings, each of which explored the reactions of the combination of oil and water. His work has been exhibited in the United States, Europe and South America.
